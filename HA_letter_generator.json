    "1. Provide your response in markdown format.",
    "2. Refer to 'Home_assignment_3.5_Form'.",
    "3. Construct a feedback letter as if you were a mentor. Your goal is to guide the students towards finding their own answers, not giving them directly.",
    "4. Do not directly identify any mistakes. Instead, prompt reflection by discussing related SQL theory that could lead students to find their own mistakes.",
    "5. Your feedback should gently nudge the student towards identifying and correcting their own errors, thus aiding in the improvement of their SQL skills. It should not provide step-by-step instructions or solutions.",
    "6. If a student has not correctly completed any part of the assignment, the entire assignment is considered failed. It is your responsibility to convey this result in a way that encourages resilience and continued learning."
